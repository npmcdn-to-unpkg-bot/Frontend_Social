                <h5>We collect the following types of information from our users:</h5>
                <br>

                <p>
                    We may receive and store any information you submit to the Application (or

                    otherwise authorize us to obtain from your Facebook account). The types of 

                    personal information collected may include your full name, email address, 

                    gender, IP address, browser information, username, demographic information, 

                    and any other information necessary for us to provide the Application services.

                <h5>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</h5>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We receive and store certain types of usage related information whenever you

                    interact with Application. For example, TOURGOAT may automatically 

                    receive and record information regarding your computer’s IP address, browser 

                    information, Facebook user ID, Facebook Page fan status, and URLs accessed. 

                    Such information may be shared in aggregate (non-personally identifiable) 

                    form with our partners.

                <p>
                    TOURGOAT uses the information described in this Privacy Statement (i)

                    internally, to analyze, develop and improve its products and services, and (ii) as 

                    set forth below in the “Will TOURGOAT Share any of the personal 

                    information it Collects” section below.

                <p>
                    TOURGOAT may provide personal information to the applicable Application

                    Partner. The Application Partner’s use of your personal information is subject 

                    to the Application Partner’s separate privacy policy – and not this Privacy 

                    Statement. The Application Partner’s privacy policy is linked to from within 

                    the Partner’s Facebook application.

                <br>
                <p>
                    Personal information about our users is an integral part of our business. We

                    neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone (with the exception of 

                    sharing your information with an applicable Application Partner – see the 

                    “Application Partner Treatment” section above). We share your personal 

                    information only as described below.

                    Application Partners: We will share your personal information with an 

                    applicable Application Partner (see the “Application Partner Treatment” section 

                    above). Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf

                    and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to 

                    you. Unless we tell you differently, TOURGOAT’s agents do not have any 

                    right to use personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary 

                    to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of personal information for the 

                    above purposes. Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or 

                    sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one 

                    of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if TOURGOAT, or 

                    substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that 

                    TOURGOAT goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information 

                    would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You 

                    acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of 

                    TOURGOAT may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this 

                    policy.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Protection of TOURGOAT and Others: We may release personal information

                    when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; 

                    enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the 

                    rights, property, or safety of TOURGOAT, our employees, our users, or others. 

                    This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations 

                    for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. <br>

                    With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your 

                    personal information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to 

                    prevent the sharing of this information.
